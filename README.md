# MISK DSI Individual Assignment : Red Wine Quality EDA Report

In this assigment we've implemented the methods and techniques that we've learned during the week. we used R to produce a EDA report.

we've used the Red Wine Quality dataset.

# Input variables 

| Fixed Acidity        | Most acids involved with wine that are fixed or nonvolatile                                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Volatile Acidity     | Amount of acetic acid in wine                                                                                    |
| Citric Acid          | Can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines.                                                                         |
| Residual Sugar       | Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops                                                               |
| Chlorides            | Amount of salt in the wine                                                                                       |
| Free Sulfur Dioxide  | Free Form. Prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine                                                   |
| Total Sulfur Dioxide | Free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations.                                                              |
| Density              | Closeness of density to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.                        |
| pH                   | Describes how acidic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)                                |
| Sulphites            | Wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels. Acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant. |
| Alcohol              | the percent alcohol content of the wine (% by volume).                                                           |
| Quality              | Reviews of wines on a 1-10 scale.                                                                                |
